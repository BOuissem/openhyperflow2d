Minimum System Requirements
===========================

* CPU:           x86_64 compatible;
* OS:            Linux x86_64 (tested on OpenSUSE 10+, SLES 10+, CentOS 6+, Scientific Linux 5+);
* C++ compiler:  GNU C++ 4.1+ or Intel C++ 10+;

Recommended System Requirements
===============================

The main (and most effective) version of OpenHyperFLOW2D is parallel MPI version.

Recommended requirements for this version:

* CPU: Multicore (4+) CPU with SIMD (SSE3+) instruction support (Intel Xeon or AMD Opteron);
* Linux Cluster 10+ nodes;
* Infiniband interconnect (SDR/DDR/FDR)
* MPI2 library with Infiniband support (Intel MPI 3+, MVAPICH2 1+, HP MPI).
   OpenMPI also support but have some problem with non-bocking data exchange.
* Multicore/multiprocessor workstations are also recommended to use parallel MPI version of
  OpenHyperFLOW2D (OpenMP version is also available, but it has performance problems)


Installation
============


1. Configure C++ compiler


2. Configure parallel features


3. Build
